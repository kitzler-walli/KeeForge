# Scripts

Local developer tooling. Folder rule: hand-run scripts live here; anything CI or Xcode Cloud invokes lives in `ci_scripts/` (see `ci_scripts/README.md`).

## Current Scripts

- `normalize-xcstrings.swift` — rewrites `.xcstrings` catalogs into Xcode's canonical serialization (space-padded ` : `, `localizedStandardCompare` key order, expanded empty objects, no trailing newline); without it a plain-JSON edit produces a large reordering diff on Xcode's next round trip. Run `swift scripts/normalize-xcstrings.swift` after any programmatic catalog edit (per `AGENTS.md`): no args = all tracked catalogs, file args restrict the set, `--check` writes nothing and exits non-zero on drift (no CI job runs it). Swift on purpose — the key order depends on Foundation's `localizedStandardCompare`.
- `generate-merge-fixtures.sh` — regenerates the KeePass Synchronize merge oracle fixtures under `TestFixtures/Merge/` (see `TestFixtures/README.md`). Builds one deterministic base database with `pykeepass` (KDBX 4.0 — `keepassxc-cli db-create` only writes KDBX 3.1, and KeeForge's writer is KDBX 4 only), then drives every divergence through `keepassxc-cli` and records the reference with `keepassxc-cli merge -s`. Needs `python3` with `pykeepass` and KeePassXC's `keepassxc-cli` (`--keepassxc-cli PATH` overrides the default `/Applications/KeePassXC.app/…`). Slow on purpose: KDBX timestamps have one-second granularity and merge resolution is timestamp-driven, so the script sleeps between edits whose ordering decides the outcome. `--list` prints the scenario ids, `--scenario <id>` (repeatable) rebuilds a subset, `--output DIR` writes elsewhere. Needs no Xcode and no repo lock.
- `with-repo-lock.sh` — repo-wide, cross-worktree mutex for local Xcode work. Serializes builds, unit/UI tests, iOS Simulator runs, and macOS app tests so parallel agent sessions (main checkout plus every `.claude/worktrees/*`) never contend for the toolchain, the simulators, or the screen. Wrap a command with `with-repo-lock.sh xcode -- <cmd>`, or hold it across several steps with `acquire`/`release`; `--status` shows the holder. The lock directory lives under the shared git common dir (`git rev-parse --git-common-dir` → `.git/keeforge-locks/`), which is what makes it global across linked worktrees; locks whose holder process died are reclaimed automatically. A wait means a lock directory exists; if the lock path cannot be created and no holder exists, it fails promptly with exit 73 instead of waiting. Usage and exit codes are in the script header; the agent-facing policy is in `CLAUDE.local.md`.
- `nextcloud-e2e/` — throwaway Nextcloud for `KeeForgeUITests/NextcloudLoginFlowE2EUITests.swift`. `up.sh` starts it with Docker on `127.0.0.1:8480` (compose project `nextpass-e2e`, user `e2e-admin` / `e2e-admin-password`) and (re)uploads `TestFixtures/test.kdbx` to `/Vaults/nextpass-e2e.kdbx`, so run it before every test run; `verify.sh` downloads the database afterwards and uses `keepassxc-cli` to check the saved `Watch E2E` entry (Apple Watch tag, username, password, TOTP); `down.sh` removes the container and its data. Full cycle:

  ```bash
  scripts/nextcloud-e2e/up.sh
  TEST_RUNNER_NEXTCLOUD_E2E_URL=http://localhost:8480 scripts/with-repo-lock.sh xcode -- \
    xcodebuild test -project KeeForge.xcodeproj -scheme KeeForge \
    -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
    -only-testing:KeeForgeUITests/NextcloudLoginFlowE2EUITests
  scripts/nextcloud-e2e/verify.sh
  ```
- `test_with_repo_lock.sh` — offline regression fixture for the lock wrapper. It covers normal wrapping, `acquire`/`release`, a held lock, a disappearing `EEXIST` race, and an unusable lock directory.

## Guidance

- Keep scripts runnable from the repo root with no setup beyond standard dev tooling (`swift`, `xcrun`, `jq`).
- If a script must run in CI or Xcode Cloud, move or duplicate it into `ci_scripts/`.
