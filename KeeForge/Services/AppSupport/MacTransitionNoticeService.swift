/// Two builds sharing `at.kw.nextpass` make the App Group's availability
/// itself a signal. macOS binds the container to one signing
/// `validationCategory`, and the losing build is denied — so on first launch
/// the Mac app sees one of exactly three things, and the notice has to be
/// right in all of them:
///
/// - **A list is there.** An upgrading install whose container resolved.
/// - **No list, container fine.** A genuinely fresh Mac install.
/// - **No container at all.** `AppGroupContainer.resolvedURL` is nil when the
///   group is denied. A fresh install always gets its
///   group, so this can only be the denied case — which is precisely when the
///   user is staring at an empty list and most needs the instructions.
///
/// The third case is why this does not simply ask whether the file exists:
/// when the group is denied there is no container URL to ask about.
