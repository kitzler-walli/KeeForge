/// Store (universal purchase with iOS) and as a notarized Developer ID direct
/// download. The two differ in what they are *allowed* to contain, not just in
/// how they behave — Sparkle must not be present in an App Store build, and
/// StoreKit is meaningless in a direct one — so the split is a build-time
/// condition, not a runtime setting.
///
