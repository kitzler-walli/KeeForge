# Services Folder

This folder is the integration layer between app logic and the outside world: App Group storage, file/bookmark access, cloud SDKs, Keychain, system APIs, AutoFill helpers, and app-level support services.

Each subfolder's `CLAUDE.md` loads automatically when you work in it.

## Start Here

- `Persistence/DatabaseListStore.swift` is the persisted source of truth for known databases (`DatabaseReference`: read-only flag, per-database `autoFillEnabled`, `lastMasterKeyChangeAt`, cloud sync metadata), cached copies, backup directories, and the active AutoFill database selection.
- `Persistence/LocalDatabaseSaver.swift` and `Cloud/CloudDatabaseSaver.swift` are the main save-path entry points.
- `Cloud/CloudSyncCoordinator.swift` owns cloud download-before-open and post-save cache/reference refresh behavior.
- `AutoFill/AutoFillSaveCoordinator.swift` owns the extension-safe save path for new credentials.
- `Security/KeychainService.swift` owns composite-key storage with biometric access control.
- `BrowserBridge/` (macOS only) serves the NextPass browser extension on 127.0.0.1; see its `AGENTS.md`.

Platform scope: macOS supports local files and WebDAV, not the
iOS app's Dropbox or OneDrive connections. Mac AutoFill fills passwords,
passkeys, and one-time codes and can save a passkey registration, but
AuthenticationServices does not expose the iOS extension's password-save,
password-generation, or picker-created password-entry flows. Shared source
membership means code must compile on both platforms; it does not imply
identical runtime capabilities.

## Change Carefully

- Several service files are compiled into both the app and the AutoFill extension; see `../../AutoFillExtension/AGENTS.md`. If you add dependencies, keep them extension-safe and update `../../project.yml`. The AutoFill shared source list is duplicated as two byte-identical allow-lists in `../../project.yml`, delimited by the `>>> SHARED AUTOFILL ALLOW-LIST` / `<<< SHARED AUTOFILL ALLOW-LIST` marker comments under the `KeeForgeAutoFill` and `KeeForgeMacAutoFill` targets; keep them literally identical (same paths, same order) and always edit both together. Separately, the `KeeForgeMac` app target compiles the *entire* `KeeForge/Services` tree (only `AppSupport/MacLockMonitor.swift` is excluded from the iOS app target), so every new service must compile on macOS.
- `AppSupport/ClipboardService.swift` is on the shared AutoFill allow-list, but only its iOS branch is ever called from an extension (opt-in "Copy Verification Code on AutoFill"). The macOS branch clears through an in-process timer that would die with the extension, so the coordinator gates the behavior on `#if os(iOS)`; the Mac extension compiles the AppKit branch without calling it. `SettingsService.clipboardTimeout` therefore lives in the App Group defaults (with a one-time read-through migration from the legacy app-local value) so both processes agree on the expiry.
- Favicon fetching (DuckDuckGo, opt-in, default off) has a platform-split plaintext disk cache — full statement in `AppSupport/AGENTS.md`; keep `FaviconService`'s mac branch extension-safe. `Security/ScreenProtectionService.swift` hosts both platforms' screen-privacy implementations — see `Security/AGENTS.md` and `../../docs/macos-security-notes.md`.
- App Group identifiers, bookmark semantics, backup directory layout, and Keychain access group behavior are compatibility boundaries. Avoid casual renames or storage format changes. `KeeForgeTests/AppGroupGuardrailTests.swift` pins the App Group write surface — full statement in `Persistence/AGENTS.md`'s guardrail section. MSAL's token-cache keychain group is platform-split; see `Cloud/AGENTS.md`.
- Keychain access-group ordering invariant: `at.kw.nextpass.sharedkeychain` must stay FIRST in every target's `keychain-access-groups` array or the shared composite keys are stranded — full statement in `Security/AGENTS.md`.
- Keep SDK-specific cloud behavior behind `CloudProvider`-style abstractions so the rest of the app stays testable.
- Local and cloud-backed save flows share the same backup/cache rules but differ on conflict checks: local files gate on the `SaveBaseline` hashes (open-time SHA512, plus the reconciled remote hash during a merge save); cloud save layers remote revision verification and typed write-scope failures on top. Timestamped backups are written in three places — `Persistence/LocalDatabaseSaver.swift` and `Cloud/CloudDatabaseSaver.swift` (both prune to keep the 5 newest via `DatabaseListStore.pruneBackups`), plus `Cloud/CloudSyncCoordinator.swift`, which backs up the shared cache before a sync-down overwrites a not-yet-uploaded AutoFill save.
- Pending-upload marker invariants: see `Cloud/AGENTS.md`.
