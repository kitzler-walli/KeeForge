/// Toolbar status for a database that cannot be edited — KDBX 3.1, or editing

/// A `Button`, not a bare `Image`: a toolbar sizes a button's glyph to its own
/// control metrics, while a loose image keeps body size and reads a size small
/// beside its neighbours. Pressing it explains which of the two reasons applies,
/// the way `CloudSyncWarningButton` explains its own state.
///
/// `eyeglasses` rather than a lock: the lock glyph is what the Lock Database
/// button next to it uses, and two locks in one toolbar say nothing about
/// editing being off. Not an eye either — that is the reveal-secret control
/// everywhere else in the app, and the entry detail shows one on its password
/// row while this sits in the same window's toolbar.
