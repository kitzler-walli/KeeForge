# macOS Security Notes

Honest per-platform security deltas for the native macOS app. This is a living
note (no date prefix): it describes how KeeForge's macOS build differs from iOS
and what those differences do and do not protect against. Keep it truthful — it
backs the README security-highlights row and the in-app Settings copy.

## In-memory secret model — unchanged

The `EncryptedValue` + per-session `SymmetricKey` model is pure
Foundation/CryptoKit and ports to macOS with no changes. Secrets are re-encrypted
in memory, lock clears the session key and invalidates access, and composite keys
live in the Keychain rather than as raw master passwords. macOS is at parity with
iOS here.

Passkeys have the same parity: the imported private key PEM
(`KPEX_PASSKEY_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM`) is diverted out of `customFields` at parse time
and held as a session-key-sealed `EncryptedValue` (`KPEntry.passkeyPrivateKey`),
exactly like the entry password and TOTP secrets. It is decrypted just-in-time
for WebAuthn signing in the AutoFill extension and becomes unreadable on lock.

Accepted residuals of this model (on both platforms):

- Protected values captured inside `unknownXML` opaque fragments are re-rendered
  with embedded plaintext for round-tripping (`KDBXParser`'s protected-value
  re-render), so a protected field inside an unrecognized element still lives as
  a plaintext string until the entry is freed.
- Other user-defined `Protected="True"` custom fields remain plaintext `String`s
  in `customFields`; only the password, TOTP secrets, and the passkey private
  key are session-key sealed today.
- Transient `String`/`Data` copies made during parsing and signing cannot be
  zeroized (see "Swift `String` does not zeroize" below).

## App Group container minimization

On iOS the App Group container (`group.com.keevault.shared`) is sandbox-private.
On macOS, KeeForge minimizes the shared surface regardless of container
permissions: only encrypted KDBX bytes, security-scoped bookmarks, and filenames
are written there — never key material or app-only plaintext metadata.

Slice 06 tightens one specific case: the **favicon disk cache**. A favicon cache
is a plaintext, per-domain fingerprint of the vault's entries (which sites you
have logins for), so it is deliberately kept **out** of the group container on
macOS:

- **iOS** keeps the favicon cache in the App Group container so the AutoFill
  extension can read icons without re-fetching.
- **macOS** keeps it in the app's own sandbox container (Application Support).
  The macOS AutoFill extension therefore
  renders without favicons or re-fetches them rather than widening the
  group-container exposure. (`FaviconService.cacheDirectory`.)

The same relocation applies to **cloud-account records** (the
`KeeForge.cloudAccounts` defaults key). These records carry PII — Dropbox and
OneDrive account emails, WebDAV `user@host/path` display strings — so:

- **iOS** keeps them in the App Group `UserDefaults` suite (sandbox-private;
  unchanged behavior). The AutoFill extensions do not read this key.
- **macOS** stores them in the app's own sandbox defaults
  (`UserDefaults.standard`). The extension never reads these records, so there
  is no reason to put the PII in shared storage.

## Lock lifecycle — driven only by `MacLockMonitor`, and unconditional

macOS has no "scene entered background" moment worth locking on (windows
background on minimize and app hide), so `MacLockMonitor` is the whole lock
lifecycle: screen lock, screensaver start, system sleep, fast-user-switch
session resign, the last window closing, and — only under the strict `Lock
Automatically` option — app deactivation. It applies
`SettingsService.macLockPolicy` itself, and that picker (Settings ▸ Security) is
the only lock switch the Mac exposes.

The window-close trigger exists because ⌘W (File ▸ Close Window, an item
`KeeForgeCommands` has to supply itself — see `KeeForge/App/README.md`) closes
the only window without quitting, while the session lives in app-level
`@State`: without it an unlocked
vault would sit decrypted in memory with no window to lock it from and no
File ▸ New Window to get it back. `NSWindow.willCloseNotification` fires the
lock only when no window that could host the app's UI remains (sheets and
panels never count; the Settings window does, and closing it later re-runs the
check). Like every other trigger it is unconditional and policy-independent.

That notification arrives *after* the close is committed, which is too late for
the two states that defer a lock instead of taking it (below) — their prompts
belong to views that go away with the window, so ⌘W with unsaved work left the
vault decrypted with nothing on screen to resolve it. `MacWindowCloseGuard`
therefore answers `windowShouldClose(_:)` first, for the close that would leave
no host window behind: it lets a close with nothing unsaved through, hands an
open editor its own Save / Discard / Keep Editing prompt (only the editor can
save the fields it holds), and asks the standard Save / Don't Save / Cancel
itself for a dirty draft, whose save it can drive. Cancel keeps the window and
the session; anything else closes the window once the vault has locked. It
proxies each window's delegate rather than replacing it, so SwiftUI's own
delegate still receives everything else.

A deferred lock is the one hole in the guarantee, and it is deliberate: while a
lock request waits on an unsaved-work prompt, the vault stays decrypted —
session key, composite key and the whole tree — for as long as the prompt goes
unanswered, with no time bound and no timer that will end it. The four triggers
that mean the user walked away (sleep, screen lock, screensaver,
fast-user-switch) can therefore leave a machine sitting on a prompt over a
decrypted vault; only the trigger the user causes while sitting in front of the
machine — the window close — is guaranteed to be answered then and there. The
alternative is writing the user's data without an explicit Save, which the app
does not do.

The lock path is therefore **unconditional** once a trigger fires:
`DatabaseViewModel.handleSceneDidEnterBackground()` locks on macOS without
consulting `SettingsService.lockOnBackground`. That key is iOS-only (`Lock When
App Goes to Background`, rendered only by the iOS Security settings screen), so
gating the Mac on it would let an imported or shared-defaults `false` silently
disable the whole macOS lock guarantee with no UI to notice or repair it.
macOS also never takes the iOS clipboard exemption: every Mac lock trigger
means the user walked away, so the copy is scrubbed (see "Clipboard" below).

## No lock-driven biometric auto-unlock on macOS

`BiometricAutoUnlockPolicy.allowsAutomaticUnlock` is `false` for the native Mac
app, so the iOS-style auto-unlock — a system prompt raised as a lock cycle
begins — never runs there.

Instead the Mac unlock screen listens for Touch ID inline
(`Views/Unlock/MacInlineTouchID.swift`): an `LAAuthenticationView` waits for a
finger without any system alert, so nothing pops up on a Mac the user walked
away from. It listens only while NextPass is the active app; resigning
invalidates the context, so a backgrounded NextPass never consumes a touch meant
for another app. The same enrolled-finger requirement applies as for the button,
and the keychain item's `.biometryCurrentSet` access control is still what
releases the composite key — the inline view only changes where the prompt is
drawn. If LocalAuthentication refuses the inline view, the unlock screen falls
back to the standard "Unlock with Touch ID" button for that launch.

The reason is the same one that disables it for iOS apps running in
compatibility mode on a Mac (#84): `scenePhase == .active` does not prove the
window is frontmost. On macOS it is worse — `MacLockMonitor`'s triggers are
delivered synchronously while the scene still reports `.active`, and sleep and
fast-user-switch resign do not deactivate the app at all. An automatic attempt
would therefore fire in the same turn as the lock the user's *absence* just
caused, raising a prompt against a machine that is locking, sleeping, or
running a screensaver; and because an attempt that comes back
`.promptUnavailable` returns its lock cycle's one attempt, it would retry
rather than settle.

`SettingsService.autoUnlockWithFaceID` remains meaningful on the Mac: it still
gates the macOS AutoFill extension's auto-unlock
(`AutoFillExtension/CredentialProviderCoordinator.swift`), which runs in its
own foreground extension context.

## Screen privacy — layered, and best-effort on macOS 15+

iOS uses `UIScreen.isCaptured` to shield the app while it is being recorded.
macOS has no equivalent signal, so protection is layered:

1. **Deterministic blur cover on resign-active.** Whenever KeeForge stops being
   the frontmost app it places a frosted-glass overlay over every vault-content
   window, lifted again when it becomes active. On by default, with its own
   "Blur Windows When Inactive" setting (Settings ▸ Security) that is
   independent of the toggle below; turning it off leaves an unlocked vault
   readable to anyone glancing at the screen while another app is in front.
   The **Settings window is excluded** — it shows no secrets, so covering it
   would be visual noise; capture blocking is still applied to it uniformly
   through the single choke point.
2. **Best-effort capture blocking** (the "Block screen capture" setting, default
   on). A single choke point applies `NSWindow.sharingType = .none` to every
   window; new windows inherit the current policy through the key-window
   observer, so there are no per-window call sites. **This is best-effort: on
   macOS 15 and later, ScreenCaptureKit-based capture ignores `sharingType`**, so
   a determined screen recorder can still capture the window. When it does work
   (including some screenshot and legacy-capture paths), a screenshot of
   KeeForge comes out black or fails — that is the protection working, not a
   bug.

This matches the competitive landscape: Strongbox ships the same opt-in toggle,
Bitwarden blocks by default, KeePassium relies on screen-lock instead.

## Clipboard / Universal Clipboard ceiling

macOS applies the `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType` marker (hides copied values
from clipboard-manager apps) and a changeCount-guarded clear timer plus
clear-on-lock. But **macOS cannot exclude a copy from Handoff's Universal
Clipboard**, so a copied password may briefly appear on the user's other devices'
clipboards. iOS can set `.localOnly`/expiry; macOS cannot. This is surfaced
honestly in Settings → Security.

Clear-on-lock is unconditional on macOS. iOS exempts one case — backgrounding
the app, which is when the user switches away to paste (issue #34) — but that
exemption deliberately stops at the platform line: it leans on the
system-enforced `.expirationDate` and `.localOnly` that macOS does not have, and
every Mac lock trigger (screen lock, screensaver, sleep, user switching) means
the user walked away from the machine rather than switched apps. Since the
macOS clear timer is an in-process `Task`, it does not survive app termination,
which makes the scrub-on-lock the real bound here.

## Attachment previews rely on FileVault

Attachment preview/share writes short-lived plaintext temp files that are removed
on dismiss and on database lock (`AttachmentPreviewFileStore.clearAll()`). On iOS
these are written with Data Protection (`.completeFileProtection`). **On macOS
per-file Data Protection is inert** — setting a protection class fails with EPERM
(verified on macOS 26), so `Data.WritingOptions.atomicProtected` omits it on macOS
and at-rest encryption is provided by **FileVault** instead. The same rationale
governs every protected write in the app (see `PlatformCompat.atomicProtected`).
Quick Look itself uses SwiftUI's native `.quickLookPreview(_:)` on macOS; iOS
keeps the `QLPreviewController` representable.

## Non-T2 Intel hibernation caveat

On Apple Silicon and T2 Macs the encrypted hibernation image and secure memory
handling limit what a powered-off-then-imaged attack recovers. On **older Intel
Macs without a T2 chip**, hibernation/sleep images and swap are weaker, and an
unlocked session's decrypted secrets could in principle be recovered from disk if
the machine is seized while suspended. FileVault plus locking on sleep is the
mitigation; there is no app-level fix.

## Entitlements and hardened-runtime posture

Reviewed against the shipping build before the first Mac release. Both channels
are sandboxed and hardened-runtime, and **neither carries a single
`com.apple.security.cs.*` exception** — no disabled library validation, no
allow-jit, no unsigned-executable-memory, no `get-task-allow`. Sparkle 2 needs
none of them: Xcode signs its XPC services with the same team id, and library
validation permits a same-team load. `ci_scripts/build_mac_direct.sh` enforces
this on the app *and* on every nested bundle it embeds, so an exception added to
the AutoFill extension or to a Sparkle XPC service fails the release build
rather than shipping quietly.

The two channels no longer share one entitlements file. The App Store build uses
`KeeForgeMac/KeeForgeMac.entitlements`; the direct build uses
`KeeForgeMac/KeeForgeMacDirect.entitlements`, which is the same file plus one
key. What the **App Store app** asks for, and why:

| Entitlement | Why it is needed |
| --- | --- |
| `app-sandbox` | Required for the Mac App Store, kept for the direct channel too. |
| `files.user-selected.read-write` | The user picks a `.kdbx` themselves; there is no other way to reach it. Grants access to what they chose, nothing else. |
| `files.bookmarks.app-scope` | Re-opening that same file after relaunch without asking again. The alternative is a file picker on every launch. |
| `network.client` | Cloud sync (currently WebDAV on macOS), opt-in favicon fetching, and the user-initiated feedback form. |
| `network.server` | The browser extension bridge, which listens on 127.0.0.1:19735 only (see "Browser extension bridge"). |
| `application-groups` → `group.com.keevault.shared` | The only channel through which the AutoFill extension sees a database. See the container caveat above. |
| `keychain-access-groups` → `com.keevault.sharedkeychain` | Composite keys shared with the extension. Must stay **first**: an item stored without an explicit `kSecAttrAccessGroup` lands in the first listed group. |

That list is the whole of the App Store build. The direct build adds exactly one
more key, and it is a `temporary-exception`, so it is worth being precise about:

| Entitlement (direct channel only) | Why it is needed |
| --- | --- |
| `temporary-exception.mach-lookup.global-name` → `com.keevault.app-spks`, `com.keevault.app-spki` | A sandboxed app cannot submit Sparkle's installer job itself; it reaches the InstallerLauncher XPC service over these two mach names. Without them the bootstrap look-up is denied and an update hangs after the download. |

What that actually widens: the app may look up two names in the bootstrap
namespace, both derived from its own bundle identifier and both registered by
Sparkle's own helpers. It grants no filesystem, network, or code-execution right
of its own. What it does reach is the installer that replaces the app bundle —
which is the entire point of the channel, and whose authenticity gate is the
EdDSA appcast signature plus notarization/Gatekeeper, not the sandbox. The Mac
App Store build carries no temporary exception at all, and
`ci_scripts/verify_mac_artifact.sh` fails either artifact that drifts: the direct
one must carry both names and enable `SUEnableInstallerLauncherService`, the MAS
one must carry neither.

This was found by running the rehearsal below, not by reading the code. The feed
fetch, the download and the signature check all succeeded without it; only the
install step was unreachable, and it failed silently at a progress window.

An earlier draft also carried
`com.microsoft.identity.universalstorage`, MSAL's macOS token cache group, which
the shipping build never exercises: Dropbox and OneDrive are hidden from the
macOS UI (`CloudProviderKind.isAvailableOnCurrentPlatform`), so nothing on a Mac
authenticates through MSAL and nothing writes to that group. It was removed
before the first release rather than after — a Developer ID profile embeds the
entitlements it authorizes, so changing the set later costs a profile
regeneration and a re-sign.

Be accurate about what that bought. Keychain access groups are namespaced by the
team prefix, so `$(AppIdentifierPrefix)com.microsoft.identity.universalstorage`
was only ever reachable by apps signed with this team's identity — Microsoft's
own apps included a different prefix and could not reach it. Removing it closed
no path an attacker had. What it does is keep the entitlement set equal to what
the app actually uses, so a future reviewer of this file does not have to
re-derive why an unused permission is there.

The larger version of the same question is still open: `SwiftyDropbox` and
`MSAL` remain dependencies of the `KeeForgeMac` target, and
`DropboxCloudProvider.swift` / `OneDriveCloudProvider.swift` compile into it, so
both OAuth SDKs ship inside a binary whose UI cannot invoke them. Cutting that
means `#if`-guarding the providers and giving up the property that their code
stays compiled and unit-tested on both platforms. Not done, and deliberately so.

Whoever unhides OneDrive on macOS must add the keychain group back — MSAL checks
for it by suffix match before enabling its cache, and silent token refresh
across relaunch does not work without it — and regenerate the Developer ID
profiles in the same change. Both entitlements files carry that note.

## AutoFill extension boundary

The macOS AutoFill extension is the process that holds decrypted vault contents
while it fills, so its entitlement set is deliberately the **smallest of the
four targets** — smaller than the app's, and identical to the iOS extension's
apart from `app-sandbox`, which iOS extensions get implicitly:

- **No `network.client`.** The extension cannot reach the network at all. It
  cannot sync, cannot fetch favicons, and cannot exfiltrate over a socket even
  if a parsing bug were exploited inside it. Cloud work belongs to the app.
- **No `files.user-selected.read-write`, no `files.bookmarks.app-scope`.** The
  extension cannot resolve a security-scoped bookmark or reach the user's
  original `.kdbx` on disk. It reads only the encrypted copy the app cached into
  the App Group container — which is why the app refreshes that copy on save.
  It writes only there too: a save it makes (a new passkey, say) waits in that
  copy under a pending marker until the app writes it into the file, and only
  if the file has not changed since, so the extension never gains file access.
- **One keychain group**, the shared one, in the same order as the app's, so a
  composite key written by either process is readable by the other and by
  nothing else. MSAL's group is app-only and intentionally absent.

The boundary is enforced by more than review: `AppGroupGuardrailTests` pins the
group container's write surface to encrypted KDBX payloads, bookmark blobs, and
filename metadata. Widening that surface is a security change, not a convenience
one.

The memory ceiling is a separate constraint with a security edge:
`KDFExecutionPolicy.autoFillExtension` bounds what a hostile KDBX header can ask
the extension to allocate. It is the **only** KDF guard on macOS, where
`os_proc_available_memory` does not exist and the iOS pre-flight has nothing to
read (`AutoFillExtension/AGENTS.md`).

## Browser extension bridge

The NextPass extension for Brave and Chrome (`BrowserExtension/`) is new attack
surface: the app listens on 127.0.0.1:19735 and answers credential requests.
What bounds it:

- Off unless the user turns on "Allow Browser Extension" (Settings ▸ AutoFill),
  so a Mac that never uses the extension exposes no port at all.
- Loopback only, so nothing off this Mac can connect. Every request must carry
  `Origin: chrome-extension://<NextPass extension ID>`; browsers set that header
  for extension requests and web pages cannot forge it, so no website can reach
  the bridge. A local process can send any header, which is why pairing exists.
- Nothing but `status` and `pair` answers an unpaired extension, and an
  unpaired `status` reveals nothing about the vault. Pairing needs the user's
  click on a NextPass dialog showing the code the extension's popup displays;
  one dialog at a time, a few per five minutes. The app stores only hashes of
  each extension's random key, in its own Keychain access group — its
  preferences file would let any process running as the user approve itself.
- A client gets five seconds to send its request and at most eight are
  served at once, so a local process cannot exhaust the app's file
  descriptors.
- Credentials leave one entry at a time, only while the vault is unlocked, and
  search results carry no secrets. The extension fills only frames on the
  page's own site (registrable domain, from the Public Suffix List), plus a
  site the user explicitly allowed on that site after being told a login form
  comes from it, so an unannounced third-party frame never receives a
  password. Password copy goes through the app's clipboard handling, never
  through the browser.
- The extension holds host access to every http(s) site from install, as
  KeePassXC-Browser and Strongbox do — the browser cannot inject into an
  embedded sign-in frame (Apple's idmsa.apple.com) otherwise. It declares no
  content scripts, web-accessible resources, or external connections, so no
  page can see or message it; it runs code in a page only when the user picks
  an entry to fill.
- Residual: anything that can run as the user and read the browser profile can
  take the extension's pairing key and, while the vault is unlocked, request
  credentials — the same exposure KeePassXC-Browser accepts. Any website can
  tell whether the port is open, i.e. that NextPass is running with the
  extension allowed; it learns nothing else. Local malware with
  that reach can also read the screen and keystrokes (see below).

## Sparkle update channel — direct builds only

Attack surface the iOS app never had, and it exists in exactly one of the two
channels. The App Store build cannot contain an updater by construction: Sparkle
is declared in `project-direct.yml`, an overlay spec, so a plain
`xcodegen generate` produces a project with no Sparkle package in it at all.
There is no runtime flag to get this wrong.

The Info.plist keys are a separate question from the code, and they did get it
wrong. `KeeForgeMac/Info.plist` is shared by both channels and fills `SUFeedURL`
and `SUPublicEDKey` from build settings; those settings come from
`BuildConfig.local.xcconfig`, which applies to the whole project, so the App
Store build shipped a live feed URL and public key it had no Sparkle to read.
Inert, but it advertised an update channel in a Mac App Store binary. `project.yml`
now blanks both settings on the `KeeForgeMac` target and `project-direct.yml`
inherits them back, which puts the safe value on the default spec.

The channel boundary is also checked after export by
`ci_scripts/verify_mac_artifact.sh`. It requires the MAS artifact to have no
Sparkle framework, updater XPC, feed, public key, or updater strings, and the
direct artifact to have Sparkle plus an HTTPS feed and public key. It rejects
StoreKit linkage in a direct artifact even when the UI is hidden by a runtime
condition. The direct compilation condition now excludes `StoreKitManager` and
`TipJarView`, removes StoreKit from the shared macOS review-service build, and
compiles out the app's StoreKit startup reference; the runtime
`DistributionChannel` check remains a second line of defense.

What authenticates an update in the direct channel:

- **EdDSA signatures.** Sparkle verifies each download against `SUPublicEDKey`
  before it will install. The private half lives in the login keychain, never in
  the repo and never in CI logs. Losing it strands every direct install with no
  supported way to update them — treat its backup as a release-critical secret,
  not a developer convenience.
- **HTTPS appcast.** `SUFeedURL` must be `https://`. The release script refuses
  to build otherwise, and refuses an empty `SUPublicEDKey`, so a direct build
  that could not authenticate its own updates never reaches notarization. The
  signed zip is hosted as an immutable GitHub Release asset. Draft assets are
  verified through authenticated GitHub API bytes; after the release is
  published, the final public download URL is verified separately. The staged
  feed is published only with that evidence and an atomic base-feed
  compare-and-swap, so a concurrent feed change cannot be silently replaced.
- **Notarized, stapled payload.** The zip the appcast serves is the stapled app,
  so a first launch offline still passes Gatekeeper.

Residual risk to be honest about: whoever controls the appcast host and the
EdDSA private key together can push code to every direct install. That is
inherent to self-distributed updates. The App Store channel does not have this
property, which is one reason it is the default build.

### Manual Sparkle rehearsal (test feed only)

The initial rehearsal was completed before v1.16.0. Run it again after changing
the feed host, signing key, updater configuration, or release handoff. This is
a manual test on a disposable Mac or VM; it is not a production publication
procedure. Never place the private key, a vault password, or a token in a
command, appcast, screenshot, or log.

1. [x] User-attested prerequisite: the recovery copy of the Sparkle EdDSA
   private key is backed up. Do not record its contents or location, and do not
   generate, export, or print it during the rehearsal. Prepare two
   direct-download apps:
   an older notarized/stapled build and the newer notarized/stapled build that
   will be tested. They must use the same key pair and the same planned
   `arm64,x86_64` architecture set.
2. Create an isolated HTTPS test host (a temporary hostname or local TLS
   service with a trusted certificate) and a test appcast containing only the
   newer build. Sign the exact newer zip with Sparkle's `sign_update` using the
   login Keychain key; copy only its public `sparkle:edSignature` and byte
   `length` attributes into the enclosure. Use the test feed URL in the older
   app's `SUFeedURL`; never point this rehearsal at `https://keeforge.com/appcast.xml`.
3. On a clean test account, install the older app from its notarized zip and
   run `ci_scripts/verify_mac_artifact.sh --channel direct --app <older-app> \
   --architectures arm64,x86_64`. Open a disposable copy of
   `/Users/tan/Documents/test.kdbx.zip`, unlock it, and leave the vault visibly
   unlocked while starting the update check. Confirm Sparkle downloads the
   exact newer zip, verifies its signature, replaces the app, and does not
   present a hardened-runtime or sandbox exception.
4. After the updater relaunches KeeForge, confirm the newer version is running,
   the vault is locked, and unlock is required again. This is the important
   relaunch boundary: no unlocked session or decrypted vault content may be
   carried across the updater restart. Re-open the disposable vault and verify
   that it still reads correctly.
5. For the tamper test, make a byte-level copy of the newer zip, alter one byte
   without changing the appcast signature or `length`, and serve that altered
   file at the enclosure URL. Check for updates from the older app. Sparkle
   must reject the download, leave the older app installed and running, and
   report no successful installation. Restore the exact signed zip afterwards.
6. Download the exact signed zip afresh in a clean account, retain its browser
   quarantine attribute, and launch it without manually clearing quarantine.
   Confirm Gatekeeper accepts the stapled app and the direct artifact verifier
   still passes. Remove the test app, test feed, temporary vault copy, and any
   test logs when the evidence has been recorded without secrets.

The package is not complete until the off-machine key backup and both halves of
this rehearsal (successful update and altered-zip rejection) have been observed
on the real direct artifacts. The repository verifier only proves static
artifact properties; it cannot replace this end-to-end trust-chain test.

Both halves have been observed, against a local HTTPS test feed, on notarized
1.15.0 (3) → 1.16.0 (4) artifacts sharing one key pair: the update downloaded,
verified, installed and relaunched with no hardened-runtime or sandbox
exception; the vault was locked and required its password again afterwards; and
a one-bit-altered zip served under the unchanged appcast signature and length
was refused as "improperly signed", leaving the older app installed and running.
That run is what found the sandbox entitlement gap above — every stage before
the install had succeeded, so nothing static revealed it.

Re-run this whenever the feed host, signing key, updater configuration, or those
sandbox entitlements change. Record current release evidence in the candidate
manifest and keep durable security conclusions in this document.

### The downloaded zip is its own trust surface

Step 6 is not a formality, and it is not weaker than the rest. It found that the
direct zip Gatekeeper accepted on the build machine was **rejected on a clean
Mac** with "unsealed contents present in the root directory of an embedded
framework".

The app was fine; the packaging was not. `ditto -c -k` stores each file's
extended attributes as an inline AppleDouble `._name` entry. Apple's own
extractor consumes those entries, so Finder, Archive Utility, `ditto -x -k` and
Sparkle's updater all produce a correct bundle — which is why every check that
ran on the build machine passed, and why the whole Sparkle rehearsal passed.
Plain `unzip`, and most third-party unarchivers, instead materialize them as
real files inside the bundle: 201 of them, one landing in the root of
`Sparkle.framework`. All of it is unsealed content the signature does not cover,
so the app the user actually double-clicks fails to launch.

`ditto -c -k --sequesterRsrc` puts those entries in a `__MACOSX` sidecar beside
the bundle instead, where no extractor can push them inside it. The only
attribute this bundle carries is `com.apple.provenance`, which nothing signed
depends on, and the stapled ticket is a regular file (`Contents/CodeResources`)
that survives any extractor.

`ci_scripts/build_mac_direct.sh` now proves this per build rather than trusting
the flag: it extracts the finished zip with plain `unzip` and fails the build
unless the result has no AppleDouble strays, is accepted by Gatekeeper, and
still validates its staple. The general lesson is that verifying the exported
`.app` says nothing about the artifact users receive — the damage exists only
after a zip round trip, so the round trip is what has to be checked.

The corrected packaging was then re-tested the same way the failure was found —
downloaded afresh on a clean Mac, quarantine attribute intact, launched without
clearing it — and Gatekeeper accepted it.

## Not fixable at the app level

These are outside KeeForge's control on macOS and should not be represented as
solved:

- **Malware already granted Accessibility or Screen Recording permission** can
  read the screen and synthesize input regardless of `sharingType`.
- **Admin-level memory dumps** (e.g. attaching a debugger as root, or reading
  another process's memory) can reach decrypted secrets while a vault is
  unlocked. The session-key model raises the bar but cannot defeat a privileged
  local attacker.
- **Swift `String` does not zeroize.** Decrypted secrets that transit Swift value
  types cannot be reliably wiped from memory; an `mlock`/`SecureBytes`-style
  buffer is epic backlog, not shipped. Key material is handled more tightly:
  the composite key is a CryptoKit `SymmetricKey` (CryptoKit zeroes its backing
  storage on release), and the `Data`/array intermediates KeeForge itself builds
  from it — KDF inputs and outputs, master and HMAC keys, the ChaCha20
  outer-cipher state, the Keychain write buffer — are wiped with `memset_s`
  (`Models/SecureWipe.swift`); Argon2 runs through the reference C `argon2_hash`
  directly so no wrapper keeps copies. Still out of reach: the bytes the
  Security framework hands back on Keychain read (and its own copies on write),
