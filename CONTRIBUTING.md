Thanks for helping improve KeeForge.

## Before You Start

- For a substantial change, open an issue first so the scope and approach can be discussed.
- Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), then the folder-local `README.md` nearest to the code you plan to change.
- Keep changes focused. Security-sensitive parser, writer, crypto, secret-handling, and save-path changes require focused tests.

## Requirements

- iOS 18+ and macOS 15+
- Xcode 26+
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)
- Swift 6 with strict concurrency
- Swift Package dependencies: [argon2](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2), [SwiftyDropbox](https://github.com/dropbox/SwiftyDropbox), [Microsoft Authentication Library](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-objc), [swift-psl](https://github.com/ameshkov/swift-psl), and the vendored [KeeForgeTwofish](Vendor/KeeForgeTwofish) package

## Build From Source

```bash
cp BuildConfig.local.example.xcconfig BuildConfig.local.xcconfig
xcodegen generate
open KeeForge.xcodeproj
```

For iPhone and iPad, select an iOS 18+ simulator or device and run the
`KeeForge` scheme. For Mac, run the `KeeForgeMac` scheme on macOS 15 or later.

For command-line verification, prefer the smallest relevant test slice:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project KeeForge.xcodeproj -scheme KeeForge \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' \
  -only-testing:KeeForgeTests/DatabaseViewModelTests -quiet

xcodebuild test -project KeeForge.xcodeproj -scheme KeeForgeMac \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  -only-testing:KeeForgeMacTests/DatabaseViewModelTests -quiet
```

## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch from `main`.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that addresses the issue.
3. Add or update tests, using the smallest relevant test target and `-only-testing:`.
4. Add user-facing feature and bug-fix notes for every platform under `## Unreleased` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
5. Open a pull request describing the behavior change and how it was verified.

A maintainer reviews every pull request before it is merged. KeeForge uses squash merges, so please keep the pull request focused and give it a clear title.

### Which branch to target

Target `main` for everything by default.

When a release is being prepared there is also a live `release/{major}.{minor}` branch soaking on
TestFlight. Only target that branch if a maintainer asks you to — it is reserved for fixes to bugs
found in the release candidate, and every commit landing there forces a new build and restarts the
testing window. Maintainers port those fixes to `main` separately; do not open the same change
against both branches.

Three status checks must pass before a pull request can merge:

- **unit-tests** — runs the `KeeForgeTests` unit suite on an iOS simulator.
- **macos-unit-tests** — compiles the shared unit sources against the native Mac app and runs `KeeForgeMacTests` on macOS.
- **DCO** — verifies every commit is signed off (see below).

## Developer Certificate of Origin

KeeForge uses the [Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO). By signing off a commit, you certify that you have the right to submit the contribution under the repository's open-source license.

Sign off each commit with Git's `-s` option:

```bash
git commit -s -m "fix: describe the change"
```

This appends a trailer like this to the commit message:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

The sign-off is a certification, not a cryptographic signature; `git commit -s` is different from `git commit -S`.

If commits already exist without sign-offs, add them while rebasing onto the current `main` branch:

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase --signoff origin/main
```

Because rebasing rewrites commit history, update the contributor branch afterward with `git push --force-with-lease` when necessary.

## Licensing

By submitting a contribution, you agree that it is licensed under the same GNU GPL terms that cover this repository. You also represent that you created the contribution or otherwise have the right to submit it under those terms.

Do not submit code copied from an incompatible source. Call out third-party code, generated assets, or other material with separate license or attribution requirements in the pull request.
